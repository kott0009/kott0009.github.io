            <h2>About me</h2>
            <h3>Kavithma</h3>
        </header>
        <p>My name is Kavithma Kisanduni.Currently I live in Sri Lanka.Presently I am doing the Advance Level Eexaminatio in Sri Lanka.
            I study English Literature,French and <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>for my Advanced Level Examination.
            I have chosen <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> in order to accomplish my future dream. I always wanted to be a profesional 
            photographer and a graphic designer.Since my childhood I studied <abbr title="Information and Communication Technology">ICT</abbr>.My parents 
            guided me to choose those subjects on account of the usage of the new technology in the modern era.In this modern generation we should be capable 
            to interact with the technology.This course helps us to gain a sufficient knowledge regarding the current technology in the world.</p>

        <p>I always wanted to achieve my future goal as an edducated and indipendant person.Since my 6 <sup>th</sup> grade I was with lot of inferiorities regarding my life, but 
            my self confidence and the strong desire to success helped me to overcome those challemges.<em>All you need in this life is ignorance and 
            confidence,and then success is sure.</em> </p>
